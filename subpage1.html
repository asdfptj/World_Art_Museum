            In ancient Egypt, figures were drawn in different sizes according to
            their social status, so the pharaoh, a living god, was relatively
            larger than other figures. And the statues of ancient Greek art were
            lively and pursued the ideal beauty of perfect proportions and
            balance.

            The reason why the roof of Milan Cathedral rises sharply is to show
            the faith of medieval people who tried to get closer to God. And as
            the Middle Ages changed into a God-centered society, art also began
            to pursue religious ideals. So, during this period, the production
            of paintings and sculptures related to religion as well as
            architecture was active.

            Compared to the Middle Ages, the modern era is different in that it
            revived the artistic ideals of Greco-Roman culture and expressed
            humans and nature more realistically and ideally. In addition,
            people were expressed dynamically by using strong colors and
            light-dark contrast. During this period, aristocrat-centered art was
            developed, and many colorful, elegant, and decorative works were
            produced.
